                <h3>Thoughts on the day:</h3>
                <p>
                    I'm taking COGS 108 and CSE 110 this quarter, and even though both classes have mandatory group 
                    final projects, the group project experience for each class is already so different. 
                    It's so annoying how I take the time to join one COGS 108 group early before the formation deadline, but now I'm getting ghosted 
                    by the person organizing the group. I always understood that groups should meet/talk at the start for introductions/icebreakers because it's
                    the nice thing to do, but I never realized why it is important until now. I really appreciate now the effort that Professor Powell 
                    puts into forcing us to interact with our group members for this class, because it actually feels so terrible when 
                    no interaction happens.
                    I feel like if professors want to have mandatory group projects on that basis that working with groups is an essential skill, they should 
                    put the same effort as CSE 110 in preparing their students to work in groups. If we really <em>need</em> this skill for future work, then shouldn't 
                    you as the professor do more to encourage group success, rather than throwing students to the wolves? I feel like it doesn't even have to be much,
                    just something as simple as "Treat your group members like humans" during week 1. I don't know, that's my little rant I guess.
